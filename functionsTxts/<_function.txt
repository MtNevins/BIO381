###  '<'
#### Matthias Nevins
##### R funtion "<" is a *RELATIONAL OPERATION*. This binary operation can be used to compare atomic vectors. 
```{r}
# e.g. You could assign a variable "a" to a random set of numbers and then determing which of those numbers are less than a selected value
runif(10)
a <- runif(10)
a < .05
# Or you could create two variables and compare them
x<-5
y<-6
x<y
```
